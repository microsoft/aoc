# Analog-Optical Computer (AOC)

This repo contains the code for the Digital Twin (DT) used in Microsoft Research's AOC project.
The DT can be used to train fixed-point models to run on either the newer 2300-weight or the 256-weight AOC machines.

The core of the digital twin is the AOCCell class which attempts to model the physics of the analog-optical device.
